HERMIONE;It's hurting again isn't it, your scar.
HERMIONE;You know Sirius will want to hear about   this. What you saw at the world cup,  and the dream.
HERMIONE;Alastor Moody? The aura.
HERMIONE;   Because they are unforgivable. Use of  any one of them will…
HERMIONE;Stop it! Can't you see it's bothering  him, stop it!

HERMIONE;It's not going to work.
HERMIONE;You see this? This is an age line. Dumbledore  drew it himself.

 "
HERMIONE;Go on Harry. Harry for goodness sake.
HERMIONE;We've already been  through enough people why don't you  just go and do it yourself? Ughh. What do you want me to say again?

Her latest prey sources report   is none other than the Bulgarian bon-bon                          Viktor Krum. No word yet on how Harry  Potter's taking this latest emotional  blow.
HERMIONE;"They're not for Ginny they're for you! Dress robes.
 "

HERMIONE;Oh well spotted.
HERMIONE;I won't be going alone because believe it or not someone's asked me. And I said yes.
HERMIONE;Hot isn't it? Viktor's gone to get drinks. Care to join us?
HERMIONE;What's got your wand in a knot?
HERMIONE;The enemy?? Who was it wanting his autograph? Besides, the whole point of the tournament  is international magical cooperation, to make friends.
HERMIONE;"How dare you! Besides I can take care  of myself.
 "
HERMIONE;What? What? That's what you think?
HERMIONE;You know the solution then don't you.
HERMIONE;Next time there's a ball pluck up the  courage and ask me before somebody else  does, and not as a last resort.
HERMIONE;Where have you been? Nevermind! Off  to bed both of you.
Luna;Quibbler...? Quibbler...?
Luna;"There’s an article on Wrackspurts
this month. Quibbler...?"
Luna;"He’s lovely. They’ve been known
to sing on Boxing Day, you know.
Quibbler?"
Luna;"They’re invisible creatures that
float in through your ears and
make your brain go fuzzy.
(moving off)
Quibbler? Quibbler?"
Luna;Hello, Harry.
Luna;"Wrackspurts. Your head’s full of
them."
Luna;"It’s alright. I enjoyed our walk.
It was like being with a friend."
Luna;That’s nice.
Luna;Who are those people?
Luna;"Would you like me to fix it?
Personally I think you look a bit
more devil-may-care this way. But
it’s up to you"
Luna;"No. But I’ve done several toes
and how different are they really?"
Luna;Episkey.
Luna;Exceptionally ordinary.
Luna;"Hello, everyone. You look
dreadful, Ron."
Luna;"Is that why you just put something
in his cup. Is it a tonic?"
Luna;"I’ve never been to this part of
the castle. At least not while
awake. I sleepwalk, you see.
It’s why I wear shoes to bed."
Ginny;Hedwig...? Mum!
Ginny;Exactly. How’d you guess?
Ginny;"Now you’re joking. I was only
wondering when Harry got here."
Ginny;"Harry Dimpleton. Harry Potter, of
course."
Ginny;"Well his trunk’s in the kitchen.
And his owl."
Ginny;"Me, nosy. Is he up there with
you?"
Ginny;"Harry’s. Haven’t seen him, have
you? Apparently, he’s wandering
about the house."
Ginny;None of your business.
Ginny;Please. What’s a Wrackspurt?
Ginny;"He’s covered in blood again. Why
is it he’s always covered in
blood?"
Ginny;"Piss off, Cormac. How ‘bout I
toss you a floater?"
Ginny;Who’s the Half-Blood Prince?
Ginny;"That’s what it says. Right here.
‘This Book is the Property of the
Half-Blood Prince.’"
Ginny;What’s gotten into him?
Cedric;Yes sir. 
Cedric;Alright.
Cedric;Are you serious? And Fleur and Krum, do they...?
Cedric; Right. Hey listen, about the badges. I've asked them not to wear them.
Cedric;How are you?
Cedric;"Look I realise I never really thanked 
                         you properly for tipping me off about 
                         those dragons."
Cedric; Exactly. You know the prefects bathroom  on the fifth floor?
Cedric;It's not a bad place for a bath. Just  take your egg and mull things over in  the hot water.
Cedric; Get down!
Cedric;Get off me!
Cedric;Harry! Harry!
Cedric;You know for a moment there I thought  you were gonna let it get me.
Cedric;Some game huh?
Cedric;Go. Take it, you saved me!
Cedric;"You ok?
"
Cedric;Where are we?
Cedric;It's a portkey. Harry the cup is a portkey
Cedric;What is it?
Cedric;Who are you? What do you want?
Cedric;Harry take my body back will  you? Take my body back to my father.
