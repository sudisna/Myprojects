Here will be the list of all the projects I have done and the updates on them :

1) IBM Watson Personality Insights



**IBM Watson Personality Insights:**

**Scope Of The Project:**
To use an api connection to IBM watson personality insight to get big5 score for both fictional characters and real people.

**Description Of The Project:**
This was my first individual data science projects, I took script from HARRY POTTER movies from kaggle and then
connected to api of IBM WATSON PERSONALITY INSIGHTS. Then assigned individual confidence interval of big 5 score for each houses.

Based on these scores then I took datasets of the celebrities with their big5 scores (based on their tweet post) and then tried to sort them into HARRY POTTER houses.

**Language Used:** Python

**Tools Used:** 1.Jupyter Notebook 2.Tableau

**Skills Used:**
1. Data Cleaning 
2. API connection
3. Data retrieval
4. Data Analysis

**Steps Followed:**
1. Download the harry potter movie script having characters and their dialogues dataset from Kaggle
2. Import the file in the notebook and do the data cleaning
3. Connect to the ibm api and process the dataset to get a new dataset containing big5 score for each character
4. Clean the retrieved dataset from ibm api
5. Do data analysis to find the big5 score for each houses and set a confidence interval for each house
6.Check the rankings of houses wrt to big5 score and fan ratings and see whether the hypothesis is correct or not
7.Import a new dataset with celebrities and their big5 score based on their twitter post
8.Do data analysis to check their mean score and see if they fall into the confidence interval which we created earlier.

**Goal of the project:** To sort the celebrities into  harry potter houses based on their average big5 scores
